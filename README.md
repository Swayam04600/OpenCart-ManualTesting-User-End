# OpenCart E-Commerce Website — Manual Testing Project

## QA Portfolio Project (User Module Testing)

This repository demonstrates a complete **end-to-end manual testing cycle** performed on an OpenCart based E-commerce web application.
The project simulates the work of a **QA Engineer in a real software company**, including requirement analysis, test design, execution, defect reporting, and release assessment.

## Application Under Test (AUT)

**Application Type:** E-commerce Web Application
**Platform:** OpenCart
**Module Tested:** User End (Customer Side Only)

### Key User Functionalities

* Account Registration
* Login / Logout

## Defect Reporting Method

Each defect was documented with:

* Steps to Reproduce
* Expected Result
* Actual Result
* Severity
* Priority
* Screenshot Evidence

### Types of Defects Identified

* Form validation failures
* Incorrect error messages
* Broken navigation links
* Checkout workflow issues
* Session handling problems
* UI inconsistencies

---

## Entry Criteria

* Application deployed successfully
* Requirements available
* Test environment configured

## Exit Criteria

* All test cases executed
* Major defects logged
* Test summary prepared

---

## Test Execution Summary

All planned test cases were executed and results recorded in the Test Execution file.

The application contains functional and validation defects affecting checkout and user input handling.

---

## QA Release Decision

**Release Status: NOT APPROVED**

Reason:
Critical validation and checkout workflow issues may impact customer orders and user experience.
Fixes and full regression testing are required before production deployment.
