# 🧪 OpenCart E-Commerce Website — Manual Testing Project

## 1. Project Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end **Manual Testing** performed on an OpenCart based E-commerce web application.

OpenCart is an online shopping platform where users can:

* Register an account
* Browse products
* Add items to cart
* Place orders
* Manage order history

The objective of this project was to validate the system functionality, identify defects, and evaluate whether the application is ready for production release.

### Modules Tested

* User Registration
* Login & Logout
* Forgot Password
* Product Search
* Product Details Page
* Add to Cart

| Test Scenarios        | High-level coverage of features                                    |
| Test Cases            | Step-by-step validation procedures                                 |
| RTM                   | Requirement Traceability Matrix mapping requirements to test cases |
| Test Execution Report | Pass/Fail status of executed test cases                            |
| Bug Report            | Defects documented with severity and priority                      |

## 6. Defect Reporting

Bugs were reported with the following information:

* Steps to Reproduce
* Expected Result
* Actual Result
* Severity
* Priority
* Screenshot Evidence

### Types of Defects Found

* Form validation issues
* Incorrect error messages
* Broken navigation
* Checkout workflow issues
* Session handling problems
* UI inconsistencies

---

## 7. Entry & Exit Criteria

**Entry Criteria**

* Application deployed successfully
* Requirements available
* Test environment ready

**Exit Criteria**

* All planned test cases executed
* Major defects documented
* Test summary prepared

---

## 8. Test Execution Summary

All planned test cases were executed and results recorded in the Test Execution Report.

Based on observed behavior, the application contains functional and validation defects that should be fixed before production deployment.

---

## 9. Conclusion

The OpenCart application is **partially stable** but not fully production-ready due to issues in checkout validation and error handling.

Further regression testing is recommended after defect fixes.
