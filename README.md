# 🧪 OpenCart E-Commerce Website — Manual Testing Project

## QA Portfolio Project (Real-World Testing Simulation)

This repository demonstrates a **complete end-to-end manual testing cycle** performed on an OpenCart-based E-commerce web application.

The project simulates the actual work of a **QA Engineer in a software company**, covering:

* Requirement understanding
* Test design
* Test execution
* Defect tracking in Jira
* Release decision

The objective was to evaluate whether the application is stable enough for production release.
